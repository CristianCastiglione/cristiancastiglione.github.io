* [sgdGMF](https://github.com/CristianCastiglione/sgdGMF):
  An *R/C++* package for the estimation of high-dimensional matrix factorization models under dispersion exponential family likelihoods, including quasi-likelihood estimating equations and Negative-Binomial models. 
  In particular, the package implements well-established deterministic estimation algorithms, such as iterated least squares and quasi-Newton, as well as innovative stochastic optimization methods, such as adaptive stochastic gradient descent.
  It also provides several efficient initialization approaches, a rich environment of functions for postprocessing analysis and the possibility to perform parallel computing.

* [BayesGLMM.jl](https://github.com/CristianCastiglione/BayesGLMM.jl):
  A *Julia* package for the approximate estimation of Bayesian generalized linear mixed and additive models via efficient non-conjugate variational message passing. 
  The package supports all the most commonly used exponential family likelihoods, as well as quasi- and pseudo-likelihood models, including non-regular loss functions in a generalized Bayes framework. 
  Some examples are support vector machines, Huber regression, quantile regression and expectile regression.
  An *R/C++* implementation of this software will be released soon.
