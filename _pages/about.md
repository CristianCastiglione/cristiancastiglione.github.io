I am a postdoctoral research fellow in statistics and data science at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics ([BIDSA](https://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home)), under the supervision of [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/).

I am currently involved in the PRIN projects "Complex Graphical Models for Biological Network Sciance" and "Causes of deAth dependence stRuctures and the cOmpositioNal effecT on ovErall mortality" ([CARONTE](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/caronte.html)). 

I am interested in the development of statistical models and computational tools for the analysis of complex data characterized by non-trivial dependence structures, playing both with frequentist and Bayesian approaches.
I really enjoy implementing my own code in the most efficient way possible and I like experimenting with the specific features of different programming languages.
In all my works, I put much effort into providing user-friendly software with a wide ecosystem of tools for pre-processing, estimation and post-processing of the results to enhance the usability of the model.
Till now, I worked on environmental applications with non-stationary spatial dependence, high-dimensional omics data affected by both latent biological processes and technical sources of bias, and dynamic networks with time-varying clustering patterns.

A reasonably up-to-date version of my CV can be found [here](https://cristiancastiglione.github.io/files/cv_cristian_castiglione.pdf).
